## Things to do

### Onboarding

The first task when joining is the onboarding process. The KCD Bot will create a
channel for you. The Bot will proceed to ask questions that are mandatory to
continue onto the server with everyone else.

In addition to general chat, there are lots of ways to learn and grow with
others in the KCD Community on Discord. Here are a few ideas:

### Kent's Live Streams

The `💻 Kent Live` video channel and the accompanying `#💬-kent-live` chat
channel are where I do my live streams. Most of the time my live streams are me
coding projects or working on open source.

### Kent's Office Hours

The `🏫 Kent's Office Hours` video channel and the `🏫-officehours` chat channel
are where I host my [office hours](/office-hours). This is a time twice a week
where I go live and answer any question you have. We can even share screens.
Really anything you're working on or any general questions you have can be
answered during my office hours.

### KCD Learning Clubs

When we learn together, we learn better, and that's the idea behind the
[KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs). I definitely recommend taking advantage of these
to enhance your own learning experience with my course material or anything else
you want to learn.

## Moderators

Moderators are responsible for being good examples of the
[Code of Conduct](/conduct). They politely encourage others to do so if they
notice slip-ups. Moderators are the gardeners of the Discord. If you're active
and helpful in the community, me or my mod team will reach out to you for joining
us as a moderator for the KCD discord.
