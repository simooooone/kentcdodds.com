# KCD Office Hours

Once a week, Kent is available for an hour to answer any questions you have.
This is especially helpful for [KCD Learning Clubs](/clubs) but everyone is
invited. Office hours is held on Zoom (you need to be logged into your Zoom
account to join).

Office Hours are held weekly on Fridays at
[9:30-10:30 AM Mountain Time](<https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com/?t=9%3A30%20am&tz=Mountain%20Time%20(MT)&>).
I suggest you
[add it to your Calendar üìÜ](https://kcd.im/office-hours-cal) so you don't
miss due to timezone issues.

I also live stream it to [my YouTube Channel](https://kcd.im/youtube) where
you'll find recordings of previous office hours.

If you want to be notified when office hours begins, then go to the
[`#ü•ê-roles`](https://kcd.im/discord-roles) channel and opt-in.

## Join

To join, simply join the [KCD Discord](/discord) community, and jump in the
[`#üè´-office-hours`](https://kcd.im/discord-office-hours) channel to ask
questions and get the links that I share with my responses.

When the meeting begins, join the Zoom meeting using this link:
[kcd.im/office-hours-zoom](https://kcd.im/office-hours-zoom).

I often answer questions posted in the Discord channel, but people who are
actually *in* the Zoom call get priority.
