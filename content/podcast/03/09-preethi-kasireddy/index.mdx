Software development isn't limited to "nerds." During her time at Andreessen
Horowitz, Preethi met thousands of entrepreneurs. What she realized was that
software engineering is what these entrepreneurs use to change the world.
They're able to code the future they believe in using software engineering.

A lot of people were surprised that Preethi gave up a promising career in
venture capital to become a developer. But, Preethi says that the greatest
artists reinvented themselves often. There's something unique and special about
the periods in our lives where we are working on improving ourselves. We kind of
lose that after going through everyday life. And so we must continue to find new
hobbies and interests that we enjoy and grow with.

The world is driven by logic and what is objectively measurable is what ends up
being valued. The hedge fund manager making millions a year is doing something
objectively measurable while the artist isn't. But, beyond a certain point,
money doesn't make you happier. You have to look out for your happiness. Your
happiness is your incentive for choosing to pursue your passion over choosing
the option that makes you more money.

Go back and think about dreams you had as a child and re-evaluate those dreams
now.

<Transcript>

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Hey, hey everyone. This is your friend Kent C. Dodds And I'm joined by my
friend, Preethi Kasireddy. Say hi, Preethi.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Hey Kent.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Preethi and I met years and years ago. I actually don't remember exactly how we
first got introduced. Do you remember?

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I think it was on the internet through one of my blog posts or something.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah, yeah. I tend to meet a lot of people on on the internet. But yeah, so it's
been a pleasure to know Preethi and I'm excited for you all to get to know her.
So Preethi, could you introduce yourself a little bit, tell the audience who you
are and kind of the things you're interested in and that kind of thing?

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Sure. This is always a tough question for me because my identity has evolved
over time, but overall, I think I would classify myself as a blogger. I write a
lot. Kent and some of the JavaScript community may have known me through my blog
posts in the past.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Previously, I've worked at Andreessen Horowitz. I was a partner there. After
that, I left and I taught myself how to code, and then I joined Coinbase as an
engineer. And then after that, I ended up starting my own company. And now I'm
back to blogging again.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah. Now, I remember reading your story of your transition. I think that was
probably the first blog post I read of yours, was about that transition to
developer, and I was inspired by your story. Do you want to just tell us a
little bit about that?

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Sure. I was an engineer in college, but I wasn't a software engineer, so systems
engineer. I didn't really even knew what software engineering was. I thought it
was just a bunch of nerds in a basement coding. At least, that was my definition
of it because all the software engineers I saw on campus just look really nerdy.
And I never want to be a nerd, so I never even thought to look into software
engineering.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
When I joined Andreessen Horowitz and I would meet entrepreneurs every single
day, I met thousands of entrepreneurs over the course of two years I was there,
and basically what I realized is, software engineering is how what these
entrepreneurs use to change the world. They're able to code the future. They
believe in using software engineering.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I was like, "Wow, this is an amazing skillset to have, because then it allows
you to build whatever you want and shape the world in different ways." And even
if it doesn't mean joining a company and building a revolutionary company, you
can change the role in small, tiny ways that you just couldn't do before.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I felt like it also gives you access to a whole other underworld that you just
simply cannot understand. Like, I would try to figure out how some of these
technologies would work and I was handicapped because I didn't really understand
how the technology stack behind it worked.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
So I was like, I felt like some part of me was missing as an engineer and I
tried to teach myself how to code. And even though I failed a lot in the
beginning, I was not very good at all, I kept trying and trying and trying. And
then at some point, I hit this inflection point, where it just clicked for me
and I became so passionate about it.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I decided to leave and quit the amazing job I had at Andreessen Horowitz to
teach myself how to code. I did that and that's how I got into the JavaScript
community, because I was teaching myself JavaScript and yeah.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah, I'm inspired by that story. I remember reading it years ago and just being
inspired that you decided to take a step down, I guess, on the corporate ladder
or whatever we want to call that, where you're really successful and experienced
in what you are doing and decide to make a switch career-wise and kind of start
from square one again.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
It sounds like it was just because you're inspired by what was possible, by what
this new skill set could enable you to do. Also, there was just something that
drew you toward being able to develop software. There was some passion there.
Where do you think that comes from?

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
The passion for software?

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah or just the willingness to take the risk that you did.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Oh, okay. If I had to be completely honest, it's just from my stubbornness and
desire to just follow my heart. Ever since I was a child, I was not one of those
kids who just did one sport and could do that for 10 years and stick to it
forever. I just genuinely was very curious, so I did a few different sports.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I like to follow my passions and do what I thought I wanted to do at that
moment. So in this case, yeah, going up a corporate ladder at VC was definitely
one path, but I just didn't feel like for me personally it was the optimal path.
There's just so much more in the world that I knew I was passionate about and
that I knew that I wanted to learn about.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
At the time I was only 23 and I felt like if I really wanted to just become a
venture capitalist, I can do that when I'm 40, but right now was the opportunity
for me to go out there and learn about the world, explore and just be hungry for
knowledge and building.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I always think the greatest artists also reinvent themselves often, because if
you're doing the same thing over and over ... Times change, right? And as an
artist, you need to be able to reinvent yourself all the time. And I think
fundamentally, I operate more like an artist and a creative, in the sense that I
like to create and I know that times change and if I want to do something
different, I need to reinvent myself. I've never been afraid of sort of
reinventing myself in that way.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
So learning to code, to me, I think a lot of people viewed it as like, "Wow,
you're giving up a lot. You're giving up this really amazing career." I think
that's a really good way to look at it, but sort of like a glass half empty way
to look at it.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
The other way I think about it is, what else can I do with this new skillset
than what, that I just couldn't do if I continue down this path without that
skillset? And like I said, if I really want to go to VC, I'm pretty sure I can
make that happen. But now with the new skills that I have, I can do VC plus so
much more. And I was like, "Okay, the opportunity is just so much bigger on the
other end, so I can't imagine not taking it."

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah. Something interesting, that kind of came to my mind as we were talking
there was that, you know the early stages of when you're just learning a new
skill? Especially, I think lots of us felt that maybe when we were teenagers or
going through college or whatever it was that we went through to get to the
career path that we're on right now, there's some excitement, maybe frustration,
maybe even some fear if there's a lot riding on the line of you succeeding.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
But there's something unique and special to that period of personal improvements
and working on yourself and your own skills, and I think we kind of lose that.
And after a while, we fall into the drudgery of just everyday life, where we're
applying the same skills that we learned 10 years ago or whatever. We stop
innovating on ourselves.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Maybe we're innovating with the skills that we've developed and that's awesome,
but we stop innovating on ourselves and discovering new capabilities or
improving new capabilities within ourselves, and discovering new hobbies or
interests that we might have if we just say stay focused on what we have now and
maybe on what the world is telling us where our value lies I guess.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Exactly. This is such a hard thing for people to navigate because I think when
we're young, we have all these dreams and aspirations to follow our passions or
become this and become that. Then, you kind of grow older and older, and then
society sort of puts all these expectations on you of what they think you should
be doing.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Oftentimes, we're not at an age when we're to getting into the job market, where
we've truly found our "passion". So we give into a job or a role that will make
do for the expectations that society has. But then, our dreams kind of get
shoved under a rug, and then by the time you want to actually realize those
dreams or even have the ability to go back and reevaluate them, it might be even
too late.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I think the key thing that's missing here is, when you're young, people are not
encouraged to ... How do I put this? They're given more logical routes of how to
follow their life and career and everything because logic is the best way to
justify your decision.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Like, "Okay, if you pursued this path, you'll make the most amount of money,"
or, "If you pursued this path, you'll be the safest. If you pursued this path,
there'll be the most ... I don't know ... you get the best retirement," whatever
it is. There's logical reasons why certain career paths make sense, but all the
illogical paths, there's no rhyme or reason to follow them, so people don't
encourage you to follow them. And sometimes your dreams and aspirations follow
in those paths.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I don't mean to sound weird or crazy, but I think sometimes the illogical paths
are actually probably the right answer and the logical one might not be the
writing answer.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I started to really think about this a lot over the last year or so because I
continue to meet people, especially who are, five, 10 years older than me.
I'm 29. People who are 35, 40 who, they've accomplished a lot in their life.
They've shared a company or they're even rich or they progressed along the
career lateral. They're a VP at something or whatever it is and they're
fundamentally unhappy. And I'm like, "Hey, why are some of the most successful
people unhappy?"

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I think I realized like, I don't think they truly pursued their dream per se.
They kind of did what society laid out for them, sort of the ABC path, but then
never explored the uncharted path, if that makes sense.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah. That just makes so much sense. And honestly, I wonder why we don't talk
about this more, why we're not mindful. I think if you had a big group of people
in a room and brought them together and said, "Okay, how many of you think that
money is going to buy you happiness or whatever? Or that happiness just comes
from being financially successful or professionally successful?" I think most
people would say, "No, that's not what happiness comes from."

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
But then there's a disconnect, because I think lots of us are ... Maybe it's
just because we're too busy trying to make ends meet to stop and think about,
"Where am I going to really find happiness?" I don't know. But for some reason,
we still just pursue this stuff that we admit to ourselves that will not bring
us happiness, rather than pursuing the things that we want to or that we have a
dream about.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Not an actual dream. Maybe an actual dream, but have this desire in us that, "I
want this thing to exist. I want to be a part of this movement. I want this in
my life." We kind of put those things to the side because the world tells us
that we can't have those things until we have secured for ourselves this ... I
don't know, a nest egg or something like that. That's a shame.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Exactly. There's a few things I want to hit on, which is one, again, it comes
back to the fact that I think the world is driven by logic and what's
objectively measurable is what's valued. If something can't be objectively
measured, then it's hard for people to place a value on that. So, that's why
more creative or other endeavors are just less valued.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Why do you think you make no money as an artist or a writer compared to how much
money you can make as a hedge fund analyst? Right? But the hedge fund manager,
you're literally making billions of dollars a year. Sorry. The fund is making
billions of dollars a year, you're probably making millions of dollars a year
because the world values that, because that's just how it works. It's
objectively quantifiable, whereas art is not and writing is not.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
So as a result, "the incentives are not there" for you to pursue the more
passionate routes, but I think a lot of that ... I think what's really cool
right now is, a lot of that is starting to change, where you're starting to see
people who are truly passionate about these things can actually build.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Even if it's not your entire life's earnings, you can build some portion of your
earnings pursuing your passion, and maybe you do the other portion doing your
regular job. But there's so many tools online now to do that.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I'm seeing all the creators on Instagram and TikTok and Medium and all these
places. It just gives you access to all these things to actually pursue your
passion. So I think we're living in a day and age where, finally people can
actually make a decent living off of pursuing "their passions".

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I want to cover the second point, which is money. I think oftentimes, even the
richest people just ... And I've met really rich people too ... they're not the
happiest people. There's absolutely zero correlation between how much money you
have and how happy you are, beyond a certain point of money.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Yeah, more money makes you happy, until a certain point. Beyond that point,
there's actually no correlation and there's even charts and data to show this.
And it makes sense, because I've lived in extreme low income ... When we were
growing up we were really poor, and then I'm not poor anymore, but I'm not uber
rich either. I'm better than I was when I was a child and I can see the
difference in myself.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
When I get used to certain comforts, like being able to order an Uber to get to
places versus walking or taking the bus. All these comforts, it makes you lose
your drive and your passions. I don't know.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I don't know if it really makes me happy that I can take an Uber. There was
almost some pride I took in being able to walk and take a bus to a place because
it felt like I did something.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I don't know. I'm not sure how to even explain this in words, but money ... At a
certain point, I think what I realized is, you can get really comfortable and it
can almost make you not want to work hard to pursue your passions. It comes at
odds almost. You're so comfortable that you don't want to get out of your
comfort zone to work hard to make your passions happen. So too much money can
actually be counterproductive to you pursuing your passions and dreams and
whatnot.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah. I think that I have heard a lot of studies where you overlay money over
happiness. It scoops up and then it plateaus and then it dives down pretty fast.
Of course, that's not going to be cross-applicable to everybody in the world.
Some people find ways to have lots of money and be happy. But I do think that if
our pursuit is worldly acclaim and possessions and that kind of thing, then
those are empty and hollow things.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Maybe your pursuit is worldly wealth so that you can go off and do wonderful
things with it, and maybe that's where you can find satisfaction and fulfillment
and happiness out of having so much wealth. So, that's an avenue you can take, I
guess, but I really like this idea that you're pushing forward, of focusing on
the things that you're passionate about or the dreams that you have, just
following your heart in that way. That can be a mechanism to provide more real
value in the world than if you're just kind of guessing at what you can do to
provide value in the world.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Because I think that we could say, "Oh, well, I'm really ..." Well, I don't want
to give any specific examples. But if we just kind of say, "You know what? I
really have this dream of one day writing a novel." I guess I am going to give
an example.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
But instead of doing that, I'm going to go off and be a hedge fund manager
because that's what my dad did, that's what his dad did and that's just what we
do. That's how I'm going to sustain the lifestyle that I'm used to.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Then, there's that dream. There's a huge amount of value that you could provide
if you're doing the thing that you're excited and passionate and that you dream
of doing, that will never be realized because you're so busy trying to satisfy
other people's expectations or even your own unfair expectations of yourself.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Yeah. Exactly. I don't mean to overplay the need to find your passion because I
think where people sometimes struggle is, "Oh, look, I haven't found my passion.
Am I screwed?" I'm like, "I'm 30, I'm not passionate about anything."

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I think sometimes maybe passion is maybe even the wrong word, but it's just
things that you genuinely enjoy doing. It doesn't even have to be that it's your
single life's passion.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Sure.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Yeah. I think there's an interesting Ayn Rand quote, where she says ... Going to
your point about doing what you think other people want you to do versus doing
what you want yourself to do, and this is something I've thought about a lot
because one feels selfless, right? You're giving for the world. You're changing
the world by doing something that the world wants you to do versus doing what
you yourself want to do, which is very selfish and serves your own purpose, but
doesn't maybe serve of the world.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
She said something interesting where she was like, "Being selfless is actually
selfish." Because why are you selfless? Why do you care to do something for the
world? It's because it makes you feel good and it's like you're doing it for
yourself in the end.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
So, you can never let go of this idea that you're inherently selfish. Everything
you do, whether it's your desire to have kids, yeah, it does help the world, but
it's also because like you feel like you fulfilled a purpose in life and so you
have to just admit that.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
We can argue that literally everything we do is selfish, in which case, I think
you have to pick and choose where you want to be, "selfish". And I think it's
okay to be selfish about doing things that truly make you happy, because happier
you will put out more good energy in the world and you'll naturally do better
work as a result. And down the line, that'll have much higher value than you
doing something suboptimally in a less passionate way, but in the end, that has
actually less value in the world.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
At least I'm speaking for me personally. I know that if I'm interested in a
topic, in a subject, in a skill, in something, then I put my 110% into it. And
as a result, I'm able to do a lot and accomplish a lot with that. But if I'm
kind of 50% there, it's just nowhere nearly as ... my output is not nearly as
good as when I'm interested in it and I'm happy doing it. Right?

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I actually think more value would be created in this world if people truly did
the things that they felt they're good at and that makes them happy.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Absolutely. You know what? I agree with that totally. I think that if everybody
just focused on the things that they really were excited about, wanted to do ...
wholesome things, of course. If we're all just sitting around playing video
games, nothing's going to get done. But I don't think most people have that, an
actual passion. I'd consider that maybe more of an addiction.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
If people were intrinsically motivated to do the things that they were doing
because it's things that they're really passionate about, I do think that we
would create more value in the world. I would also say that, maybe more
important than the amount of value that you can create in the world ... I'm not
going to say maybe this ... absolutely more important than the value you create
in the world is the happiness level that you feel in your own life, and the
value that you can create as a side effect of the happiness and satisfaction
that you get from your own life.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Being selfishly self-interested in your own true happiness ... And I'm not
talking about the fleeting happiness that you can get from ... I don't know,
like you get that from getting buzzed or whatever. Not that kind of happiness,
but actual true joy and satisfaction out of life, when you get that, I do
believe we'll also get to a point in the world where you're providing more value
to the world. So, it's all upside, no downside there.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Yeah, exactly. I'm sure you can think of many examples. For example, one that I
probably relate to you on is writing and blogging, in the sense that I ... A lot
of people can't say this, but I'm genuinely passionate about writing. I
genuinely enjoy publishing posts and generally enjoy the process of teaching via
my writing.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
And I know I've impacted tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people
through my blog posts, because I get messages almost every day saying, "Okay,
this inspired me, this inspired me." So, I know this is true. I know that if you
truly do what you are excited about and what gets you up in the morning, what
makes you excited and what makes you feel good, then that energy that you put
out ... that energy for example, that I put out in my posts, I can feel the
rebound of it by the messages that I get from people who are thanking me or
whatever for that post. So I think that's a concrete example of a way that, if
you're happy, the energy that you put out in the world through your happiness
and through your work will be shown by that.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Absolutely and even if the work that you create in doing that doesn't reach the
number of people that alternative work could reach. For example, I decided to
start writing a novel last year for National Novel Writing Month. Not very many
people have read it. It's not a very good novel and still in the editing
process, but it was just so enormously challenging and satisfying and fulfilling
for me. It was really a transformative experience for me and it made a really
big impact on my life. And I have to believe that, despite the enormous amount
of hours that I spent writing, I received a positive return on that investment
in my throughput in general in life.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Before that, my hobby was basically my job. I just loved coding. And I have a
family of four kids and a wife and I spend plenty of time with them. But outside
of spending time with them I was always coding or doing open source, whatever.
And when I found the novel writing as a creative outlet, it changed things for
me in a really positive way. I think that it made me ...

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Maybe I'm not pushing out as many releases to my open source libraries, but the
ones that I do are probably higher quality just because my general attitude is
better. And even if they weren't, at the end of the day, nothing matters quite
so much as the happiness level of society in general. So, I think anything
that's going to increase the happiness level of people is a positive thing for
the world, even if the "value" is reduced.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
So either way, I think focusing on the things that ... Actually, that was a
dream of mine when I was a kid. I wanted to be a writer. I wanted to be a novel
writer. So, taking that opportunity and that significant amount of time to try
and make that happen really paid off and it's still paying off. I'm still
working on it. It's just been an awesome experience for me. Yeah, looking those
things that I dreamed of doing. And now that I'm an adult and I have
responsibilities and stuff, I kind of have lost some of those dreams. And
looking back and trying to identify some of those has just been a really
positive experience for me.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Yeah. That's an amazing story. That's really cool that you wrote the novel.
That's exactly what I mean. I see it. I see it in people who ... Because that
energy is so hard to create artificially. And everyone's different. That energy
comes for different people in different things. And it's one of those things,
it's the life force that's honestly just like, you cannot explain it. You cannot
put words on it. It's not objective. It's just there.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Because the energy is so hard to create artificially, I think that's what makes
it so valuable and powerful. And to waste that away or suppress it doing things
that doesn't give you that energy, I just think ... I don't know. You only live
once, right? So, why would you do that? That's kind of how I would think about
it.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Yeah, I think that's great. Well, so Preethi, we're coming down on our time here
and I just want to give folks the homework. So for the homework for this
episode, we want you to go back in time, maybe go on a walk or something or on a
drive. Next time you're driving in your commute, whatever, don't turn on the
podcast. Pause this podcast right now.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Wherever you're listening to it, you're probably in a situation you can do this.
But go back in your mind and think about the dreams that you had when you were a
child and reevaluate those dreams now, because when you were a kid, you probably
couldn't make those things happen, but maybe you can make those things happen
now.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
There's just something that happens between childhood and adulthood, where we
suppress those dreams or those passions, because they're not practical or they
aren't going to get us the success that we want out of life or whatever. But
reevaluate them now and consider taking the leap of doing something that may not
seem like the most logical choice.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
So that's our homework for you. Do you have anything to say about that, Preethi?

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Yeah. I'll just say a couple last things. One is that, this path that we're
talking about is not the easy one either because it's not the one that's
charted, like I said earlier, and it's not the one that gives you safety nets or
a rule book or blog posts to follow or tutorials.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
It's kind of one of those things where, if you ... it's something that you have
to kind of, on your own, you have to think independently about sort of how to
navigate this. And that's not to say there's not communities and other people
out there who are doing the things you probably want to do, but it just takes
you stepping out of your comfort zone to explore those, rather than trying to
find the path that's given.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
I often find that people don't do that because they're scared of taking the
uncharted path. But I think if you just take that step and just try it once,
even if you realize you hate it ... You hate the idea of charting your own path.
You'd rather live a more comfortable life and you come back to that, that's
fine. But I think, at least give it a shot once, rather than never trying that
in your entire life. So that's kind of where I'd end it.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Love it. Yeah. That's wonderful. Thank you Preethi so much, for giving us some
of your time today to chat with me. What's the best place for people to reach
out to you on the internet if they would like to?

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Sure. I'm on Twitter @Iam_Preethi, so you can just reach me there.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Awesome. Well, thank you so much. This was an enlightening conversation and
yeah, we'll see everyone next time.

**Preethi Kasireddy:**  
Thanks, Kent. Bye.

**Kent C. Dodds:**  
Bye.
