### Learn the basic fundamentals of JSX and JavaScript expressions

Working effectively with React requires an understanding of JSX and React
elements. Many engineers work with React for months or years without ever having
a clear idea of how JSX works or what it even really is. They memorize a list of
rules and miss out on opportunities to make their code more expressive and
maintainable.

In this workshop, you’ll learn everything you need to be effective with the
fundamental building block of React applications. When you’re finished, you’ll
go back to your applications and refactor your components to be simpler, more
flexible, and easier to maintain because of what you’ve learned.
