### Learn the foundational concepts necessary for building React applications and libraries

Building typical applications in React requires an understanding of code reuse
through custom components, using and changing data over time (called state),
handling user events, interacting with browser APIs, and making HTTP calls to
backend services.

In this course we’ll go over all of those things and more to help you become
productive with using the ReactJS framework for building applications for the
web.

- Creating custom components
- Styling your app with React

- Using React’s useState hook for managing data over the lifetime of your
  components
- Integrating third-party JavaScript libraries with your components with React’s
  useEffect and useRef hooks
- Basic forms with React
- Dynamic forms with React
- The difference between controlled and uncontrolled inputs and when to use each
- Making HTTP calls with React
